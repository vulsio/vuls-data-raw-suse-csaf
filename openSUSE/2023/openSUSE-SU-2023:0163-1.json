				"text": "This update for keepass fixes the following issues:\n\n- Update to 2.54\n\n  * Security:\n\n    + Improved process memory protection of secure edit controls (CVE-2023-32784, boo#1211397).\n\n  * New Features:\n\n    + Triggers, global URL overrides, password generator profiles and a few more settings are now stored in the enforced configuration file.\n    + Added dialog 'Enforce Options (All Users)' (menu 'Tools' → 'Advanced Tools' → 'Enforce Options'), which facilitates storing certain options in the enforced configuration file.\n    + In report dialogs, passwords (and other sensitive data) are now hidden using asterisks by default (if hiding is activated in the main window); the hiding can be toggled using the new '***' button in the toolbar.\n    + The 'Print' command in most report dialogs now requires the 'Print' application policy flag, and the master key must be entered if the 'Print - No Key Repeat' application policy flag is deactivated.\n    + The 'Export' command in most report dialogs now requires the 'Export' application policy flag, and the master key must be entered.\n    + Single line edit dialogs now support hiding the value using asterisks.\n    + Commands that require elevation now have a shield icon like on Windows.\n    + TrlUtil: added 'Move Selected Unused Text to Dialog Control' command.\n\n  * Improvements:\n\n    * The content mode of the configuration elements '/Configuration/Application/TriggerSystem', '/Configuration/Integration/UrlSchemeOverrides' and '/Configuration/PasswordGenerator/UserProfiles' is now 'Replace' by default.\n    * The built-in override for the 'ssh' URI scheme is now deactivated by default (it can be activated in the 'URL Overrides' dialog).\n    * When opening the password generator dialog without a derived profile, the '(Automatically generated passwords for new entries)' profile is now selected by default, if profiles are enabled (otherwise the default profile is used).\n    * The clipboard workarounds are now disabled by default (they are not needed anymore on most systems).\n    * Improved clipboard clearing.\n    * Improved starting of an elevated process.\n\n  * Bugfixes:\n\n    + In report dialogs, the 'Print' and 'Export' commands now always use the actual data (in previous versions, asterisks were printed/exported when the application policy flag 'Unhide Passwords' was turned off).\n",
